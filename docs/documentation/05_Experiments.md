title: Experiments (CRISPR screen in K562)
description: Functional validation of significant (FDR<0.05) selected genes using CRISPR screen in K562
---
This experiments information shows a breif primaryly screening for significant (FDR<0.05) positive selected genes using CRISPR screen in K562 cell line. We conducted two replicates screening experiments lasting 14 days.


## 1. Workflow of CRISPR screen 
`dNdSFun` are available for two types of input data:
- Somatic mutation data with functional impact scores (Annotated in six columns).
- Somatic mutation data without functional impact scores. (This type data are required an additional CADD score data [link](https://jianyanglab.github.io/dNdSFun/documentation/03_data.html). Place it in the path specified by our software or provide the software with a correct path to find it.)

## 2. Quality control of CRISPR screen in K562
The statistics of comparisons are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. The corresponding fastq files in each row are listed in Table 3.

## 3. Results of CRISPR screen in K562 (Negative selection with RRA method)
This result will be update when the article is accepted.


## 4. Results of CRISPR screen in K562 (MLE method) 
This result will be update when the article is accepted.


## 5. All significant positively selected genes/elements using dNdSFun combining PCAWG and GEL data.
For all significant positive results, please refer to the following [link](https://jianyanglab.github.io/dNdSFun/documentation/06_dNdSFunDrivers.html).
