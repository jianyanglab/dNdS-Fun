# dNdS-Fun: a tool for detecting selection signatures of both coding and noncoding somatic mutations in cancer genomes

**dNdS-Fun** is a generalized framework that extends the classical dN/dS methodology, specifically dNdScv, to detect and quantify selection signatures on both coding and noncoding somatic mutations in cancer genomes. By integrating genome-wide functional impact scores, dNdS-Fun allows for the identification of positive and negative selection of both coding and noncoding mutations at global (genome-wide) and local (gene or element-specific) scales.

### Key Features
- **Functional Impact Scores Integration:** Utilizes genome-wide functional impact scores (e.g., CADD) to assess the potential functional importance of mutations across the entire genome.
- **Mutation Grouping:** Classifies genomic sites into two groups based on functional impact scores:
    - **More Functional Group:** Sites with higher functional impact scores (analogous to nonsynonymous mutations).
    - **Less Functional Group:** Sites with lower functional impact scores (analogous to synonymous mutations).
- **Selection Metric (ω):** the normalized ratio of observed mutations in the more functional group to the less functional group, adjusted for the number of possible sites and mutation rates. The ω ratio indicates the direction of selection and quantifies selection strength:
    - **ω > 1:** Indicates positive selection.
    - **ω < 1:** Indicates negative selection.
    - **ω = 1:** Indicates no evidence of selection.
- **Trinucleotide Context Correction:** Following dNdScv, accounts for sequence context-dependent mutation rates by modelling mutations within a 192 trinucleotide framework (considering all possible substitutions in the context of one upstream and one downstream base).
- **Global and Local Analysis:**
    - **Global Analysis:** Estimates ω within a functional category (e.g., coding sequences, promoters, splice sites, UTRs, introns, intergenic regions) across the entire genome.
    - **Local Analysis:** Estimates ω for individual genes or genomic elements, allowing for fine-scale detection of selection signatures.

### Statistical Modelling
- **Negative Binomial Regression for Local Analysis:** Models the observed mutation counts using a negative binomial distribution to account for overdispersion and varying mutation rates across genes or elements.
- **Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT):** Performs statistical testing to determine if the observed ω significantly deviates from neutrality (ω ≠ 1), indicating selection. P-values are derived from a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.

### Usage
- **Input Data Requirements:**
    - Somatic mutation data with genomic positions and functional impact scores.
- **Adjustments for Mutation Rates:**
    - Corrects for mutation rate variability due to sequence context and regional differences.
    - Incorporates trinucleotide mutation models and gene-specific covariates.
- **Applicability:**
    - Suitable for WGS or WES data.
    - Can be applied to both coding and noncoding regions.
    - Detects both positive and negative selection signatures.

### Advantages
- **Extension to Noncoding Regions:** Expands traditional dN/dS analysis beyond coding regions by using functional impact scores to evaluate noncoding mutations.
- **Unified Framework:** Provides a consistent method to detect selection across the entire genome, facilitating comprehensive analysis.
- **Robust to Mutation Rate Variability:** Corrects for context-dependent mutation rates and overdispersion, ensuring accurate estimation of selection pressures.
- **Versatility:** Capable of analyzing different functional categories and accommodating various functional impact scoring systems, and compatible with both GRCh37 and GRCh38 genome builds.

### Validation
- **Simulations:** Demonstrated reliability and accuracy in estimating selection parameters under neutral and selected scenarios through extensive simulations.
- **Benchmarking:** Outperformed existing driver discovery methods in precision and recall when applied to both simulated and real cancer genomic data.
- **Reproducibility:** Showed consistent results across different datasets (e.g., TCGA, PCAWG, 100kGP) and sequencing platforms (WES and WGS).

### Implementation
- **Software Availability:** dNdS-Fun is available as an open-source software tool on GitHub. We have also developed a web-based platform[(https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/dNdS-Fun/)](https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/dNdS-Fun/) for online data analysis.
- **Programming Language:** Implemented in R, leveraging existing statistical packages for regression modelling and statistical testing.
- **User Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation, including installation instructions, usage examples, and parameter explanations, is provided to guide users.
- **Customization:** Users can adjust parameters such as functional impact score thresholds and include additional covariates to tailor the analysis to specific datasets.

### Conclusion
dNdS-Fun represents a significant advancement in detecting selection in cancer genomes by enabling analysis of both coding and noncoding regions within a unified framework. By integrating functional impact scores and accounting for mutation rate variability, dNdS-Fun provides a powerful tool for identifying driver genes and elements under selection, offering valuable insights into tumorigenesis and potential therapeutic targets.
